A project going through general e2e flow from ui to backend

Functionality:
The project is a general skeleton project dealing with the e2e flow of an application starting from the Web UI and managing all the way to servlet to BO layer to DAO layer and working on backend database.
It follows the MVC pattern.

Project Flow:
User opens the Home page and then will see the login area and will be available with a link to register first.
After directing to register page the user will register and then go back and do the login.
After logging in the the user will be able to go to home page to see the general functionality.
